Requirements:
- Camel case


features:
- Add a new task: Allow users to add a new task to their to-do list,
  with a name, description, and due date.
- Mark tasks as complete: Allow users to mark tasks as complete
  and see them in a separate section of the app.
- Archive tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Edit tasks.
- Search for tasks.
- User authentication.

So depending on these features, this is what I have in mind:
- If you look at google notes website, that how the navigation should look like
- then there is an aside for Archived tasks, completed tasks, and uncompleted,
  and trash, and ofc the notes
- the body should let the user to prompt for a task title, description,
  and due date
- then after the user adds a new task it should look like the youtube video 
  but it will only show the title on the left then edit and delete on the right
  then if the user clicks on the task, it will expand so the user can see the 
  the description and the due date.
